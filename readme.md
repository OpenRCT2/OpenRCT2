# 1. Introduction

**OpenRCT2** is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.

RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent open-source project, [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org). OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those include; mountain tool in-game, the *"have fun"* objective, launched coasters (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.

---

# 2. Downloading the game (pre-built)

OpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2). If you have the original RollerCoaster Tycoon and its expansion packs, you can [point OpenRCT2 to these](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Loading-RCT1-scenarios-and-data) in order to play the original scenarios.

[Our website](https://openrct2.io/download) offers portable builds and installers with the latest versions of the `master` and `develop` branches. There is also a [launcher](https://openrct2.io/download/launcher) available for Windows and Linux that will automatically update your build of the game so that you always have the latest version.

Alternatively to using the launcher, for most Linux distributions, we recommend the [latest Flatpak release](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2). When downloading from Flathub, you will always receive the latest updates regardless of which Linux distribution you use.

Some Linux distributions offer native packages:
* Arch Linux: [openrct2](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/openrct2/) latest release (`extra` repository) and, alternatively, [openrct2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openrct2-git) (AUR)
* Gentoo (main portage tree): [games-simulation/openrct2](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-simulation/openrct2)
* NixOS (`nixos-unstable` channel): [openrct2](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/games/openrct2/default.nix)
* openSUSE OBS: [games/openrct2](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=games&package=openrct2)
* Ubuntu PPA (nightly builds): [`develop` branch](https://launchpad.net/~openrct2/+archive/ubuntu/nightly)

Some \*BSD operating systems offer native packages:
* FreeBSD: [games/openrct2](https://www.freshports.org/games/openrct2)
* OpenBSD: [games/openrct2](https://openports.se/games/openrct2)

# 3. Building the game

## 3.1 Building prerequisites

OpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2).

<details>
  <summary>Windows prerequisites</summary>

  There are two toolchain options for building the game on Windows:

  - Visual Studio 2022 (Enterprise / Professional / [Community (Free)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/))
    - Desktop development with C++
  - MSYS2 MinGW Toolchain
    - The toolchains with supported dependencies are `mingw-x86_64`, `mingw-xi686`, `ucrt-x86_64`, `clang-x86_64`, and `clang-xi686`. Each of these require the `$MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX` set.
    - Note that `msys` and `clangarm-64` are lacking packages for some dependencies.

  The projects depends on several libraries to be installed. These can be installed automatically using `msbuild` for Visual Studio builds. See section 3.2 for details.
  For MinGW builds, see the wiki for [the actual package names used in pacman](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-MSYS2-MinGW).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>macOS prerequisites</summary>

  - Xcode Command Line Tools
  - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  - CMake (available through Homebrew)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux prerequisites</summary>

  - gcc (>= 8.0) or clang (>= 10.0) (for C++20 support)
  - sdl2 (only for UI client)

## 3.2 Compiling and running
### Windows:
<details>
  <summary>Show instructions</summary>

  1. Check out the repository, this can be done using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [other tools](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use)
  2. Open a new Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022
  3. Navigate to the repository (e.g. `cd C:\GitHub\OpenRCT2`)
  4. To build the x64 version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=x64`
     To build the x86 version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=Win32`
     To build the Arm64 version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=arm64`
   
     **Note:** The file `g2.dat` may not be generated on cross-compilation (e.g. building for Arm64 on a x64 machine). In this case `g2.dat` must be copied from a x86/x64 build.
  5. Run the game, `bin\openrct2`

  Once you have ran msbuild once, further development can be done within Visual Studio by opening `openrct2.sln`. Make sure to select the correct target platform for which you ran the build in point #3 (`Win32` for the x86 version, `x64` for the x64 version, `arm64` for the Arm64 version), otherwise the build will fail in Visual Studio.

  Other examples:
  ```
  set platform=x64
  msbuild openrct2.proj /t:clean
  msbuild openrct2.proj /t:rebuild /p:configuration=release
  msbuild openrct2.proj /t:g2
  msbuild openrct2.proj /t:PublishPortable
  ```
</details>

### macOS:
<details>
  <summary>Show instructions</summary>

  CMake can build either a self-contained application bundle, which includes all the necessary game files and dependencies, or it can build a command line version that links against system installed dependencies. CMake will retrieve the dependencies from [Dependencies](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/Dependencies/) automatically. You can build the macOS app using CMake using the following commands:
  ```
  cmake -S . -B build
  cmake --build build --target install
  ```
  Then you can run the game by opening `OpenRCT2.app`

  To build the command line version, you'll need to disable the macOS app bundle:
  ```

  cmake -S . -B build -DMACOS_BUNDLE=off
  cmake --build build
  cmake --build build --target install
  ln -s ../data data
  ```
  Then you can run the game by running `./openrct2`.

  To link against system dependencies instead of letting CMake download the dependencies from [Dependencies](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/Dependencies), add `-DMACOS_USE_DEPENDENCIES=off` to your cmake args.

  Detailed instructions can be found on [Building OpenRCT2 on macOS using CMake](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-macOS-using-CMake).
</details>

### Linux:
<details>
  <summary>Show instructions</summary>

  The standard CMake build procedure is to install the [required libraries](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2#linux), then:
  ```
  cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. # set your standard cmake options, e.g. build type here - For example, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
  cmake --build build # you can parallelise your build job with e.g. -j 8 or consider using ninja
  cmake --build build --target install # the install target creates all the necessary files in places we expect them
  ```

  You can also use Ninja in place of Make using `-G Ninja` in the first command, if you prefer, see Wiki for details.

  Detailed instructions can be found on [Building OpenRCT2 on Linux](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-Linux).
  
  Note: the `cmake -S . -B build` syntax is available for CMake >= 3.14. For older versions use:
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. # set your standard cmake options, e.g. build type here - For example, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
  cmake --build . --target install
  ```
</details>
