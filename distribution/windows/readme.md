# Windows Installer
This directory contains the script and resources for the Windows installer. The installer is created using [Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)](http://nsis.sourceforge.net) version v3.0a0+.

As there is currently only a 32 bit version of OpenRCT2 available, the architecture and windows version checks have been disabled. These will be re-enabled once OpenRCT2 is a stand alone executable.

Code based on [OpenTTD](http://openttd.org) installer.
